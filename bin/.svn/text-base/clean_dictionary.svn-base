# A simple script that reads in a raw dictionary (txt) file 
# produced by generating Mahout vectors from a Lucene/Solr 
# index file.
# The txt file is full of TSVs of the form
# term	doc freq	idx
# pursimo	1	101771
# pursley	12	101772
# pursue	8	101773
# pursued	12	101774
# pursues	2	101775
# pursuing	2	101776
#
# Here we are interested in obtaining a threshold
# for which terms we wish to use within the dictionaryMap.
# Therefore we read each line, calling doc freq thresholds of >=10,
# >=50 and >=100 respectively. This means we are then able to 
# write the results in to separate files effectively cleaning up
# the generated dictionary maps before being loaded in to the datastore
# of choice.
